INTRO TO DATABASES

All things we do is data and this needs to be logged; all this is logged into a database.

Raw data into tabular form; a relational database easy to do operations on such a database.

Datalake an unstructured data dump. Changing this data dump into structured data forms the datawarehouse. Datawarehouse is made up of databases.

Datawarehouse ke case mai have to define everything on the other hand datalake is very agile because data doesn't have structure in the latter.

PROCESS:

-All information is dumped with the help of a python code: DATALAKE; structured and unstructured data. Used in DATASCIENCE


-All data is cleaned and transformed into structured form according to requirements form the database. Data Engineer converts the datalake to datawarehouse basically.


So why do we even need databases?
Before everything was stored in EXCEL; data increased MSexcel became inefficient.So, came the idea of databases ab no human intervention toh less scope of error compared to logging into Excel pehle.


CLASSIFICATION:

-Heirarchal Databases: Database of higher level explained by database of lower levels. Database of lower level can only explain a single databse of lower level. Legacy Method.

-Network Databases: Database of lower level can explain multiple higher level databases. Legacy Method.

-Relational Databases: Presently in use. Rows & Columns. Simple Datatypes are stored.

-Object Oriented Databases: Complex datatypes are used like json vagera.


DATABASE MANAGEMENT / DATAWAREHOSUE DESIGN:

Measures: Values thatre put in a column.
Facts: Column header
Dimenision: Helps understand the fact better.

Design the database in such a way that no redundant copies and fast. Star Schema n Snow Flake Schema. Snowflake schema is star schema with more dimensions.


DATA LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:

-GENERATION
Data is simply info so life is data and everything about life is data generation.
-COLLECTED
Generated data needs to be collected.
-STORED
Collected data should be stored.
-VISUALIZED
Stored data needs to be visualized.
-ANALYZED
These visualizations help us analyse the data.
-ACTION
The analysis helps us take neccessary actions.
